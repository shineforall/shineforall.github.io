  <p>We are conducting a research project with one of the world’s largest foundation, <span class="br"></span> Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to develop artificial intelligence-based infectious disease <span class="br"></span> self-check algorithms and mobile self-check applications. In this project, research <span class="br"></span> participants’ symptoms and PCR test results are  collected in order to develop the next pandemic <span class="br"></span> response technology. Furthermore, KT is working with hospitals and companies that specialize in <span class="br"></span> each field to analyze telecommunication data and analyze the spread of infectious diseases. <br>All consortium members participating in SHINE project are striving to protect people’s health <span class="br"></span> by minimizaing the spread of respiratory infectious diseases like COVID-19 and flu.</p>
